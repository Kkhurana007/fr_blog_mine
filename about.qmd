Hi, I am Kunal 👋

I assist organizations, research teams, and businesses in effectively communicating insights through engaging data visualizations and graphical stories. As an independent data visualization specialist, I combine my analytical research expertise and programming skills with my passion for design, colors, and typefaces. I have designed data visualizations across all disciplines, purposes, and styles, ranging from custom, data-driven designs to automated reporting. My goal is to transform complex data into clear, impactful visual narratives that drive informed decision-making and enhance understanding.
